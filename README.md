golang
======

This package contains libraries to represent programs
of the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language in Curry.
In order to execute programs generated with these libraries,
a [Go compiler](https://golang.org/dl/) should be
installed.


Developer note
--------------

The current package supports only the representation
of a subset of Go programs (required to translate
Curry programs into Go programs). Interested people
are invited to extend the library.
